This is a patch release that fixes the installation failure of 0.6.0 reported
by the CRAN checks on `r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang` and
`r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc` ("Installation failed",
`ld: cannot find -lR`).

Cause: the build scaffold used by 0.6.0 compiled and ran a small Rust helper
binary during installation to regenerate the R wrapper file. That binary
links against `libR`, which does not exist on R builds configured without
`--enable-R-shlib` (as on the Fedora check machines). The step was
unnecessary at install time (the wrapper file ships with the package) and
is now only run during development, never by `R CMD INSTALL`. Installation
now performs a single `cargo build --lib` and links nothing against R
outside the usual shared-object step.

No changes to the R API, documentation, or behaviour of any function.

## Test environments

- Local Windows 11 (R 4.6.0, Rust 1.87): `R CMD build`, `R CMD INSTALL`
  of the tarball, and `R CMD check --as-cran`
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/check.yaml`):
  - windows-latest (release), windows-11-arm (release)
  - macOS-latest (release)
  - Ubuntu 24.04 (devel, release, oldrel)
  - Fedora 44 container (R-devel, R-hub `gcc16` image) with gcc and with clang
- R-hub v2 containers, including the Fedora-based `gcc16` (Fedora 44,
  GCC 16, matching the failing CRAN flavor) and `atlas` (Fedora 42)
- win-builder (devel)
